# Machine learning/Data science

## Description

This is a bundle compiling information (and snapshots of external repositories) related to Machine learning and Data science workshops and tutorials (if they don't have weight enough to deserve their one repository).

In particular, most content comes from the ODSC Masterclass Summit 2017 (held March 1-2 in San Francisco).

For one of the courses, the accompanying PDF is the version that comes from: [https://github.com/fluxcapacitor/pipeline/wiki/ODSC-Masterclass-Workshop-Mar-01-2017]()

## External downloads

During the masterclass, the following products were used:

1. Data Science Studio from [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com/): The 4.0.1 version was [available as a free install](https://www.dataiku.com/dss/trynow/mac/). It is still avaible there as of 2017-04-11.

   That class was mainly a presentation of the product, so I didn't get to install it and play around with it.
